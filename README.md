# Moca
Meetup and Online/Offline Conferences Aggregator - One app, many events.

## Reason of Delay
Our work was done, I (Gupta Shrinath) lost the internet connection at around 12 midnight due to which the pull request was not merged and repo was private 
## Problem Statement
- The average user is usually unaware of on-going professional events in their area or globally. For being completely aware, the user is required to keep themselves updated using various different platforms which are difficult to manage and keep up with.

## Solution
- MOCA solves this problem by aggregating events (about a specific user-interest-based topic) into a single app and single place. A SSOT (Single Source of Truth) for meetups.
    - *There is no app in the market (a/o 2020) that gathers all this info in a single place*
- MOCA also allows its users to add their own event details for COMPLETELY FREE!
    - [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) charges users to add meetups*
